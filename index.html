				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. My goal for the end of this year is to be able to design major websites, web applications, and software.</p>

				<h3>Web designer</h3>
				<p>A few years back I thought I had it in me to learn how to code websites, so I took some time to learn a few HTML tags and some in-line styles, and as a result the website looked pretty awful, but since that time I have pushed myself and crawled miles for this skill.</p>

				<h3>Game dev</h3>
				<p>In recent months I've been studying games and what makes them tick. I've always wanted to design my own game, which is another thing that kept me in this field. I've made some of those basic "hello world" type games (Snake game, simple platformer, etc.), but I'm not satisfied with what I'm capable of now, so I've been pushing myself to learn C++ and Java as well as JavaScript for browser based games.</p>
